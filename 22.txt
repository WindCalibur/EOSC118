22.2

Cabochons and carved not faceted due to not transparent
Organic - pearl, amber, and coral

22.3 - Jade

-jadeite and nephrite
- wide colours
Nephrite:
- crystallized amphibole between tremolite to actinlight
- silky, from fibrous nature of amphibole
Jadeite 
- is from pyroxene
granular texture

Jade's translucency is evaluated by maximum thickness to allow light through
	- named ventana
- Treasured by mostly Chinese and Maori of New Zealand
- used up to 5000 years ago
- Appear across workd, even BC in Cry Lake and Dease Lake Regions
	- also from Cassiar, Mount Ogden, and Bridge River
	
22.4 - Turquoise

- Antiquity and for valuable carving cabochon stone
- has Cu-Al phoshate mineral
- microcrystalline with other masses
- deposits form on surface due surface water going into Cu- rich rock
- Most famous are from Egypt, Iran and US
	- exhausted in many places, even in new Mexican or Persia(Nishapur district), and Iran
- blue to green
	- sky blue most prized
	
22.5 - Lapis Lazuli

22.7 - Ammolite 

- New gemstone, almost all from Canada
- discovered along St Mary River in southern Alberta
- Bear Paw formation - dark grey shale
	-envelope ammonite fossils(ammnolite) with round-shaped rock patches with fissile shale
- used to deduce rock's age
- from species Placenticeras meeki, Placenticeras intercalare and to a lesser degree, 
Baculites compressus
- vibrant colours, since original nacre transformed to mineral aragonite
- two categories - fractured (type 1) and sheet (type 2)
- Type 1 most common
- Type 2 - from whol shell
	- different microstructures
	- type 2 requires stabilization
Aragonite is soft, often put into composite gems with quartz, spinel, and corundum
- Doublets or "triplets" (of material)
- naturals are displayed as specimen

22.8

- concretions inside mollusks from aggravating foreign particles
- grown by Japanese entrepreneurs, namely Kokichi Mikimoto
- Can be white, black, gold, purple, brown, pink, and grey
