L17: Corundum

17.2 

hardness - 9
refractive index - 1.76 to 1.78
SG - 4.0 (silicates are 2.6)
habit - Hexagonal barrel shaped prisms - octahedron
cleavage - no common one, but will fracture in conchoidal manner
fluorescence - if much Cr but little Fe

17.3

Al2O3 - Each Al is attached to 6 oxygens

Cr gives pink to red. Rubies have about 1%wt in Cr
With Cr, it absorbs violet(450nm), some blue, green-yellow(500nm), but not red (650nm)
Cr also makes it absorb UV and re-emit red (which Fe absorbs)

intervalence charge transfer(electron bouncing) of Fe2+ and Ti4+ absorbs all light but blue
Very little needed, like 0.01%wt Fe and Ti
Multicolored in different areas of crystal - zoning

17.4

Sometimes corners of barrel shapes are worn away

17.5

Light colored stone are cut deeper to get more intensity
Heavy colored stone are cut lighter to soften intensity
Shallow cuts - light sometimes do not reflect back
TiO2 creates rutile inclusions that show asterism

17.6

Properties include mineral and fluid inclusions, low dispersion, high density, and two refractive indexs
(or dichoic)

17.7

Valued primarily on color and then clarity.
Origin has impact, so does cut and size
Higher value for gems from historical countries
4C + 1, colour, clarity, cut, carat and origin

Ideal sapphires show cornflower blue or velvety royal blue
	- velvet from Kesnmir
	- saturated blue from Burmese
	- Sri Lanka for cornflower blue
Ideal rubies are Pigeon's blood red
	- from Burma mainly
	- Some from Sri Lanka, Vietnam, and Thailand
2 carat = considered large
Good rubies show strong fluorescence
5 Categories - Exceptinal, Very good, good, fair, and poor
	- Most jewellery stores has "good"
	- High end stores have very good
	- Exceptional are only in exceptional circumstances
Record - $3.6 million for Burmese ruby in Bulgari ring sold at Christie's auction
	- 8.62 carat
1993 - 38.12 carat sold at auction for 5.9$ million
42.28 carat Kashmir sapphire sold at Christie's in 2008 at 3.5 million USD
22.66 carat but finer fetched $3 million USD in 2007
10.14 carat Padparadscha sapphire sold in 2004 for $250000

17.8

High melting temperature mean inclusions like TiO2(rutile) and spinal(MgAl2O4) are re-absorbed
into the crystal via melting. 	
	- This improves quality of stone
Fluid inclusions and fracture-type inclusions can be healed
Diffusion treatment - incorporation of element via heat and pressure
Be - used for Padparadscha Sapphires
Treathemt usually on rough corumdum since heat can create new fractures

17.9

- Made since 1837, entered market place in 1900s. Could go up to 100 carat using Czochralski's 
Drawing Method
- Components like oxides (Al2O3, Fe2O3, TiO2, Cr2O3) are molten. Seed is lowered into the magma
then raised again.
- Vernueil Process - dripping of melted corumdum onto seed
- Synthetic stones can be identified by their inclusions of growth. Cheaper than natural stones

17.10

- Imitations of Sapphire - Kyanite, blue glass, topaz
- natural colourless ruby or sapphire onto coloured synthetic corundum underneath
