L13

-emerald and aquamarine are both beryl
-resistant to many acids, transparent, colorful, hard
-requires berylium

Emerald - As far as egypt in 1500BC
	-Also known in India, South America (Colombia especially)
	-Ancient aztecs
	-Greek as "smaragdos" in Pliny's Naturalis Historia
	-First said to belong to lucifer
	-significant concentration of Cr and Vanadium(V) but not Fe
Aquamarine - light to dark blue, or delicate green tone

14.1

Beryl - an aluminous beryllium cyclosilicate (Be3Al2Si6O18) 
		- forms hexagonal prisms with flat "basal" terminations
		- hardness of 7.5 to 8
		- specific gravity of 2.6 and 2.9
		- Refractive index of 1.57 to 1.61
		- Long short wave UV fluorescence can be observed in beryl due to chromium 3+, producing red hue
		- Pink by morganite. Under UV shows orangey - pink hue
		
14.2 

- dominant crystal sites - tetrahedral sites of Si and Be, octahedra sites of Al
	- distinct channel along the c-axis within the 6 membered ring comprising of SiO4 tetrahetra
	-Substitution to A gives colours
- relatively hard to handle (Be and Li)

14.3

- Cr3+ instead of Al3+ results in green like emerald
- Fe in Al creates aquamarine
- Check table
- Emerald requires low Fe since it interferes with red from Cr3+
	- Fe needs to be sequestered before, like in pyrite (FeS) or siderite (FeCO3)
- Finest emeralds are called "Gota de Aceite", or "Drop of Oil" in Spanish

14.4

- Most Beryl crystals shows a hexagonal prismatic growth habit and basal termination

14.6

- Often confused with quartz
	- Harder than quartz (7.5-8 vs 7)
	- Flat crystal termination rather than culmination to a point
	- Beryl often has striations parallel to length of crystal, quarts is perpendicular
	- Beryl has basal cleavage and uneven fractures (quartz have conchoidal fracture)
	- Beryl can be strongly pleochroic (showing two different colors)
	- Specific gravity and refractive index and distinguish aquamarine and blue topaz

14.7

- All non-emerald beryl is Type I gem (defmined by Gemological Institude of America (GIA))
	- Type I - free of inclusions, eye clean
- Emerald is Type III gem, inclusions within stones are visible by unaided eye.
- Non-emerald can reach up to ~1500 canadian per carat except for red beryl, which is much more rare
- Emerald's inclusions called "le jardin" in french for "garden"
- Columbia, South America often display briliant and almost fluroescent gree colors
- Columbian stone will result in premium just by its name
- Finest emeralds are more rare than diamond
	- Unregulated, so value is more volatile
- Significant stones > 10 carat can go up to 10,000 USD per carat
- 2 carat = 1,000 USD per carat
- Varies from clarity, hue, colour, brilliance, polish, origin
- Highest price of 1,149,950 on 10.11 ct columbian stone
- 8.81 carat stone for 619,000 USD, from Christie's auctions
- 47 carat square step cut emerald set in a platinum antique necklace sold for approximately 
$2,600,000 USD alongside a step cut 10.22 carat emerald and platinum ring that sold for 
~$600,000 USD.

14.8

- Comon treatments

- oiling - oil forced into cracks. Seems less flawed if oil is of similar refractive index
- Some new polymers can make it harder, but can be detected from fluorescent components
- sometimes repared by epoxies if breakage occurs
- Rough beryl can be heat treated to bring out blue
- Undesirable green and yellow beryl with Fe+3 can be heated to be reduced to Fe+2, which
 gives it light blue colour
 
 14.9
 
- Can be made using hydrothermal solution. 
	- Hot thermal chemical components disolved in thermal fluids. When cooled, beryl crystals 
	will nucleate and clean stones of decent size can grow. 
	- Chatham Created Emeralds and Gilson Emeralds are two companies for synthetic Emeralds
	- Aquamarine is found abundantly so not produced synthetically
		- Often synthesized in labs for academic studies on crystal structure

14.10

- Aquamarine not imitated due to high abundance
- Emerald imitated by green glass, or thin wafers of real emerald glued with green glass and colourless
beryl
- Others include peridot, or green diopside
- Easy to investigate and find true identity
