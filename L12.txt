12.1 and 12.2

- Light travels in direction of WaveFront
- Color is what our brain interprets from incident of light
- 350nm to 750nm (violet to red) 
- White is mixture of light
- Subtractive color theory (we see light not absorbed)
- CIGEM?-
- Can use color circle to predict color based on absorbed color

12.3

- LED (light emitting diode) - emit only one light 
- light bulb emits light like a curve called spectral emittance curves

12.4

- Angle of reflection is equal to angle of refraction
- Refraction occurs when two thing have different refraction indexes
- Refraction index is how much light is slowed upon entering a material
- Fill cracks with epoxy with similar refractive index, or else diamond looks homogeneous - distracting
- Total internal reflection - when angle of incident is greater than the critical angle, which is 
dependant on the refractive index
- Maximum brilliance of a stone is achieved when much of the light that enters the crown facets reflects 
from the lower pavilion facets and then re-emerges from the crown to our eyes

12.5

Isotropic material - One refractive index that is applicable for all 3 dimensional orientations
Anisotropic - More than one refractive index

12.6

- Anisotropic - tetragonal and Hexagonal crystal systems
	- related to unique crystal structure
- Birefringence - absolute difference between refractive indexes
- double refraction because light entering is refracted into two lights due to high refractive difference
- Small difference results in blur

12.7

Dispersion - when light entering diamond is refracted by different amounts. Shorter wavelength are
refracted most
	- Measured by difference in refreaction between red (686.7 nm) and violet (430.8 nm)
- Higher valued stones show greater dispersion, spreading, or colour
- Diamond has 0.044. demantoid has 0.057 and Titanite has 0.051

12.8

- Idiochromatic - self colored
- Allochromatic - impurities
	- eg emerald where chromium is the chromosphore
- Pseudochromatic - fake colored from physical optics, from scattering, dispersion etc. 
	- Includes asterism, chatoyancy, iridescence, opalescnence, and labradorescence
- Chromosphore - element responsible for coloration

12.9

- Pleochromism - Different color from different angle of viewing
	- Best viewed using a tool called dichroscope
	- ex. Tanzanite ( 3 colours) that aline with 3 different axis
	- ex. Iolite
- Vikings used for navigation when sun is very low, used to spot sun
	
12.10

- Transparency - how light transmits through a medium
	- Transparent: objects can be viewed through medium (glass, diamond, beryl)
	- Semi0transparent: minerals where objects can be viewed through medium but is heavily blurred
		-ex. chalcedony, moonstone
	- Translucent: Object cannot be viewed through medium but light passes through with low intensity
		-ex. jade, opan, agate
	- Semi-translucent: Object cannot pass through medium and light passes only if thin
		-ex. jade, turquoise
	- Opaque: No light passes through, object cannot be seen
		ex. pyrite, malachite, galena
