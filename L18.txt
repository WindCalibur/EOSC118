18.1

Needs to be stable, low silica, and have other things like Fe, Ti etc
Three main sources:
	(1) primary metamorphic corundum in gneisses and marbles;
	(2) xenocrysts in alkali basalts and lamprophyres; and
	(3) secondary accumulation in placers
	
18.2

Metamorphic Corumdum - most significant volume from primary resources
	- produces most significant qualities of rubies and sapphires
Gneiss and marble (both metamorphic rocks) depleted of Si and rich in Al under certain circumstances
Form simple oxide like corumdum
Continued growth in extreme environment like 750C and 9Kbar
Found in continent-continent collision boundaries
Protolith - rock before metamorphosis
Marble's protolith is limestone
	- calcium, oxygen, and carbon, in form of calcite (CaCO3)
	- Mud with Al leaks into the corundum. 
	Examples: Burma(Mogok and Mong Hsu Stone Tracts), Vietnam(LucYen Region), Pakistan(Hunza)
Gneiss-hosted protolith is Al rich sediments
	- More diverse in trace metals, more colors
	Example: Sri Lanka, to Tanzania and South Kenya
	
18.3

Xenocrysts - when sapphire growth is tapped by rising magma such as alkali basalt or lamprophyre
Alkali basalts - contains BGY (blue green yellow) sapphires due to high Fe and Ti
	- Mined from primary or alluvial deposits
Rising magma entrain xenolith(rocks), or xenocrysts (crystals)
	- Xenolith are of peridotites, which sometimes contain sapphire (not all)
Sapphire can form under larger range of window diamond and are more voluminous than kimberlite

Lamprophyres intrude in Montana, USA can also be similar to alkali basalts
	- Locality called Yugo Gulch
	- late 1800s
	- Small amount today, slowing down in late 1920s
	- High quality cornflower blue color, low inclusions and color zoning
	- Size is limited
	- Also of interest is Scotland's Loch Roag
	
18.4 

Base of alluvial deposits since high SG
Can be rounded due to erosion as it gets further down stream

18.5

Intense color is rare, not corundum
Blood pigeon - needs no Fe and Ti
Velvety / cornflower - need many small inclusions

18.6

Largest corundum is 335lb
Mostly from burma

18.7

Mostly from Burma, Kashmir, Sri Lanka, Thailand
Now in every continent

18.8

Previously mined in Burma, Sri Lanka, Kashmir
Now more than 50% of colored gems are rubies or sapphires
Burma - premier source
Sri Lanka and Kashmir - premium
Other regions include Afghanistan, Madagascar, Tanzania and greenland, Kenya, montana USA

18.9 

One in Canada is Beluga Sapphire Occurence in Nunavut

18.10

Taiwan - Tzen Fu Yui 
Gasto Giuliani - France
Both document many mineral and samples
