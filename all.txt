Beryl - an aluminous beryllium cyclosilicate (Be3Al2Si6O18) 
		- forms hexagonal prisms with flat "basal" terminations
		- habit - prismatic
		- hardness of 7.5 to 8
		- specific gravity of 2.6 and 2.9
		- Refractive index of 1.57 to 1.61
		- Long short wave UV fluorescence can be observed in beryl due to chromium 3+, producing red hue
		- Pink by morganite. Under UV shows orangey - pink hue
- dominant crystal sites - tetrahedral sites of Si and Be, octahedra sites of Al
	- distinct channel along the c-axis within the 6 membered ring comprising of SiO4 tetrahetra
	-Substitution to A gives colours
- relatively hard to handle (Be and Li)
