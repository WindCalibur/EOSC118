8.1

-Diamond is the most economically and historically significant gemstone
	-historical importance, physical properties, and value
-based on adamao, greek for tame, used to describe hardness
-first mined in India, named vajra
-octahedrons = most valued. Also, its "fire" or brightness
-first century with sapphires and rubies
-Earliest reliable historical seen in tomb of wealthy young woman
-Also found in Chinese literature
-Signified power in 13th century Euro, faceted on stuff
-Royals until 17th century, where it is for upper class.
-Rose/table --> old --> brilliant (cuts)
-India(golconda, 50000 carat per year), brazil
-Kimberlite and kimberley - South Africa
-Da beers - 20th century and on

9.1 & 9.2

Diamond - cubical symmetry

	- refractive index of 2.42
4C: colour, cut, clarity, carat
-High thermal conductivity, 2x gold and silver
-low electrical conductivity
-imaginery planes - perfect clevage - carbons on same plane when cut
graphite - also from carbon
Nitrogen content:
	- Type I : above 10ppm up to 3000 ppm 
		Type Ia: Clustered (98%, absorbs blue light, yellow hue)
			-Type IaA - 2N clusters
			-Type IaB - 4N clusters
		Type 1b: Dispersed
			- could be yellow, brown, orange, green, or colourless
	- Type II : below 10ppm
		- Type IIa: no borons (<2% whitest in colour)
			- deformation results in pink, purple, and brown diamonds
		- Type IIb: up to about 10ppm of boron
			- bluish

(Check table)
- Colored diamonds are usually more expensive except for very lightly colored ones
- Strongly colored = most expensive
	
9.4 

- Most commonly octohedron
- Macles - flat tabular form
- Polycrystalline = harder than monocrystalline
	- many aggregates?
- Higher temperature -> octohedral shape
- Super saturated - grow too fast, leading to cloudy crystals or fiber-like overgrowth
- Two phases after growth: to Earth surface and transport on surface
- alluvial transport - abrasion along river
- corrosive modifications create round diamonds
- alluvial transport isn't significant since diamonds are so hard

9.5 

Detect by:
- Diamonds stick to slight grease, high thermal conductivity(best for identification), 
- low electrical conductivity
- refractive index
- nanocrystaline things making identification harder

9.6 

- Use coating and dyes to make diamond more desirable
- Use foil backing
- HPHT annealing (high temperature and pressure), (most important)
	- preverents graphitization 
	- can change nitrogen impurity conformation
	- 
- LPHT annealing (Low temperature, high pressure)
- Irradiation, which create vacancies
- Radium - surface ever after month. Neutron radiation - whole crystal
Clarity:
- Glass filling(surface flaws) 
	- lead-bismuthate glass used often
- lazer-drilling (expose inclusions) and acid boiling (removes inclusion)

9.7 

- Diamond from Carbon Vapour Deposition (CVD) and HTPT
- up to 25 carat
- Companies like Apollo, Element six, Gemesis, need authenticity certificate
HTPT:
- 1500C and 60000 atm, in chamber with molton carbon and metal catalyst
- grow diamond seed, 1 carat a day
CVD:
- diamond seed
- flow hydrogen and methane through plasma flame, destabilizing C in methane and making it attach
