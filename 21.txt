21.2

Tourmaline - stone with many colours
Topaz - antiquity, thought that this was applied to pendot, aquamarine, and citrine
Spodumene - has kunzite(pink), hiddenite(green)

21.2

Toourmaline - borosiliate, hexagonal
- long slinder crystals with pseudo hexagonal
- euhedral crystals
- vertical striations
- Two poor cleavages (uneven)
- SG of 3.2
- hardness of 7-7.5
- anisotropic - two refractive indices, from 1.61 to 1.66
- rare cases it can flouresce unde UV light

- rainbow colored
- opaque black most common
base:    XY3Z6(BO3)3Si6O18(OH)4
schorl:  NaFe3Al6(BO3)3Si6O18(OH)4
Alkali tourmaline - x = Na
Calcic tourmaline - X = Ca
Vacancy tourmaline - X = empty
- Most are alkali with difference in Y site. Most commonly Li and Al

- colour in tourmaline by transition metals substituting Al
- Watermelon tourmaline - deficient in Fe at first (pink center) then abundance of Fe (green outside)
- Pariba tourmaline - neon or electric blue
	- Cu in Y site
	- discovered in Brazil
	
20.4
Euhedral shaped
Tough tourmaline recognized by its prismatic habit and striations on its length
	- pseudo hexagonal outline
	- beryl shows true hexagonal and is harer
	- quartz is hexagonal, hard, and shows striations across long axis
- Dichroism
- less than emeralds, sapphires, and rubbies
- usually clean of inclusions
	- Chrome tourmaline upto 400 USD per carat for 1 carat stone
		- reach up to 10 carats
	- deep red-purple up to 1000 pr carat
		- up to 2 - 10 carat
	- bi - colour and yellow are more common, up to 100 USD per carat
	
- can be synthesized, but usually not since its abundant
- Paraiba tourmaline about 1000 USD/carat, up to 2 carats
	- above = way more expensive
	- 100carat = 4000 USD / carat
	- originals are depleted
	- finest Cu- colored are up to 15000 USD / carat
can be heat trated to bring darker hues to lighter or saturate lighter hues

20.5

 - aluminosilicate with F
	-orthohombic crystal system
	- prismatic crystal with 8 side
	- striations along length
	- perfect basal cleavage
	- up to 10m long, 3m across, 350 tons
	- largest cut - 22892 carat from Brazil "american golden Topaz"
	-  Al2SiO4(F,OH)2
	- Red/orangy red most rare,
	- lightly coloured or colour less, then brown blue and yellow are most common
	- from colour centers of crystal, vacancies filled with F
		- can be from lab radioactive minerals
	- Imperial (reddish-orange) originally from Ural Mountains, Russia
		- near imperial from Ouro Preto in Brazil
	- pink topax from pakistan

- euhedral crystals with sharp edges
- stable in acidic geological environments, not like tourmaline and beryl
- often with flat tops
- identified by hardness, basal cleavage, and high density
- can be confused by
	- citrine (topaz quartz)
	- smoky topaz (smokey quartz)
	- topazolite (yellow garnet)
	- light blue (aquamarine)
	- reddish-orange (zircon)
- blue/colorless 10-25 USD per carat
- imperial(orange-red) up to 1000 USD/carat
- pink up to 3500 USD/carat and rarely goes up beyond 5-6 carat

- commonly treated with irradiation, heating, and coating
- irradiation produce blue and intensify lightly colored blue, yellow and orange
- heated to produce pink
- coated for optical effects

- can be synthesized but not done due to abundance

21.7

Spodumene - Lithium baring aluminosilicate LiAlSi2O6
- base for kunzite and hiddenite
- colorless usually, light pink kunzite is uncommon
- green hiddenite is rare

- from group of minerals where ABSi2O6 where the total cation charge of A+B must equal +4
	- most members have Mg and Fe
- prismatic crystals, with two distinct cleavages, 90 degrees from eachother
- hardness of 6.4 to 7
- SG of 3.2
- refractive indices of 1.66 t 1.68
- fluoresce in short and long UV light

Kunzite - Mn (pink)
Hiddenite - Cr (green)

21.8

Kunzite confused with morganite(beryl), tourmaline, and sometimes topaz, amethyst, and rose quartz
Hiddenite confused with beryl, green glass, and diopside
Refractive index can be used to differentiate
Kunzite - common 40 - 100 USD/ carat
- Once a 47 carat one sold for 400000
- Hiddenite more rare and expensive

- Spodumene can be trated to remove defects
- heating makes faint greens and vivid pinks
- Can be synthesized but is abundance
