11.1

- 4 Cs - Cut, Clarity, Colour, and Carat
- Developed by Da Beers in 1930
- 5th C - Country of origin
	- make sure its not a conflict stone
-Cerussite - lead carbonate

11.2

- Cut is not shape (pear, cushion, rund brilliant)
- Good cut is when light entering the stone is almost all returned back
- carat depends on thickness of culet and pavilion
- Cut is measured by polish, physical proportions, and facets quality

11.3 

- Clarity is internal and external imperfections 
- Mostly by physical inclusions
- fluid filled inclusions, clouds, feathers, scratches, burns, and abrasions
- From I to Flawless
Flawless (FL): no blemishes or inclusions when examined by a skilled grader under 10X magnification.
Internally Flawless (IF): no inclusions when examined by a skilled grader, and only insignificant blemishes under 10X.
Very Very Slightly Included (VVS1 > VVS2): contains minute inclusions that are difficult for even a skilled grader to locate under 10X. VVS1: extremely difficult to see, visible only from the pavilion or small and shallow enough to be removed by minor repolishing. VVS2: very difficult to see.
Very Slightly Included (VS1 > VS2): contains minor inclusions ranging from difficult (VS1) to somewhat easy (VS2) for a trained grader to see under 10X.
Slightly Included (SI1 > SI2): contains noticeable inclusions which are easy (SI1) or very easy (SI2) to see under 10X. In some SIs, inclusions can be seen with the unaided eye.
Included (I1 > I2 > I3): contains inclusions which are obvious to a trained grader under 10X, can often be easily seen face-up with the unaided eye, seriously affects the stone's potential durability, or are so numerous that they affect transparency and brilliance.
- Measured by loupe (10x magnifying power lens)

11.4

- Colour ranges from D (colourless) to Z (deeply colored, yellow, brown, bad)
- Beyond Z = fancy or fancy intense
- Compared with master set
- Untrained eye, D - Z could be of same colour

11.5 

- Measured in carats. 1 carat is 0.2 grams. 
- 1 point is 0.01 carat
- 1 carat stone is 100 points
- Usually 2 decimal points, 3 sometimes
- Growth of price on carat is not linear (abit exponential)
- Stops growing so much after about 10 carat
- Fluxuations based on supply of diamond globally

11.6

- Mostly shaped Round Brilliant
- Computer software helping nowadays

11.7

- Grading report grades the 4 Cs
- Data from many laboratories and institutions
- One of the largest institutions is the California-based Gemological Institude of America
- certification number is engraved onto the girdle of each Diamond

11.8 

- You pay double of that in New York Firms
- Rapaport is used to summarize diamond prices
- Good color way more important in clean stones
- Small price difference between color E and F since they are so similar
- Prices go up exponentially after a few carats (5?)

11.9

- World Diamond Council in 2000, made mandate called "The Kimberly Process Certification Scheme)
	- KPCS, or Kimberly process
	- Elimination of blood of conflict diamonds
	- Makes sure retailers are not supporting illegal retailers, only get legitimate stones
	- Agreed by 81 countries
		- Some more impact than others, like US who imports huge amounts
	- Invoved with Global Witness and Partnership Africa Canada (human rights issues)
- Countries like Cote d'Ivoire,  Zimbabwe, Venezuela are countries with imperfect track record
- NGO Global Witness removed support after controversy of conflict in 2011 
- Failing recently
