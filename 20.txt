Pegmatite produces everything except diamond
	- in pockets
	- produces tourmaline, spodumene, and topaz, and beryl
	- They are intrusive igneous rocks that are very course and gigantic in size
	- significant amount of rare elements enriched (Be, Li, Cs, Ta, Nb, Y, F, Rb, Sn, Ga, and B)
	
20.3 

Pegmatite - parental pluton (granite)
	- undergo fractionation, where crystals form as magma cools
	- elements are often left over in high concentration as other elements are fractionated earlier
		- then these elements are foundin dykes under right conditions
	- Fertile - highly fractionated pegmatites
	- barren - not fractionated
	
20.4 

Groups based on 
- depth of emplacement below the surface
- range of temperature
- type of rare element enrichment

- Abyssal (high temperature, variable pressure)
- Muscovite (low T, high P)
- Rare-element (low T, low P)\
- Miarolitic (medium T, low P)

- rare-element produce most gemstones
	- Into LCT (lithium-cesium-Tantalum) and NYF (Niobium-Yttrium-Fluorine)
	- fluxes, or elements/gases that reduce freezing point allows more time for crystallization
		- also decrease nucleation, resulting bigger crystals but fewer
		- H2O, F, Cl, carbonate (CO3)-2, borate (BO3)-3, Li, and phosphate (PO4)-2
		
20.5 - 

Simple Pegmatites - homogenous texture, small crystals

Zoned pegmatites - heterogenous
	- core margin, intermediate zone, wall zone and border zone
	- border = finer grained crystals like feldspars and quartz, occasionally tourmaline or garnet
	- wall = feldspars and quartz but sometimes garnet and beryl

intermediate zone - signiicant gemstones begin to appear
	- dominated by feldspars
	- tourmaline turns into schorl and elbaite
	
core zone - best crystals
	- near end of pegmatite's life
	- "pockets" are where they originate from
	
Complex pegmatites - influx of highly volatile content, like H2O, B, (PO4)2-, F
	- produce fantastic mineral specimen
	
20.6

high volatile materials can corrode early minerals

20.7

need to be evolved and fractionated to where rare-lements are enriched
	- need to also be fertile of the rare element
	- can be funnelled through wide enough dykes to encourage pocket growth
High volatile concentrations are necessary but not too high so its not corrosive
Tectonic environment must not break crystal
slow and stead erosion needed to remove overlying rock

20.8

18m, heliodor (2000 carat), aquamarine("Marta Rocha" - 75lb)
- "Rose of Maine" - 50lb when first uncovered
- Tourmaline - 50 carats
- spodumene crystal - over 10m
- topaz - over 200lb

Pegmatites - famous ones include:
		- Brazil, Madagascar, Russia, Pakistan, US
