19.2 - Geoscientist

Trained eye can estimate dispersion, habits, fractures, and cleavages as well as inclusions
	- magnifying glass and hand lens can see finer details
Tweezers - locks stones, better grips
	- human hands are unsteady and oily
Hammers and chopsticks - 
	- Hammer needs to be hardened. Estwing a common brand
	- Geotul - 2.5lb and 30" long
	- Chopsticks and paint brushes are good for cleaning dirt
Scratch Pad and Hardness Picks
	- Streak color gives away minerals like hermatite.
	- Ruby against white ceramic plate (H~6.5). If softer, will leave streak
	- Use pencils with mineral tips to see if scratches happen, useful for quarts (H = 7), Beryl(8.5)
	or corundum (9)
	
19.3 - Gemological Tools

Loupe - hand lens, 10X
Chelsea Filter - emerald filter, useful for emeralds. Allows only green and red
Dichroscope - optic class test. Two colors for gems with two refractive index, one color for
gem with one 
UV Lamp - Short(260nm) and long (365nm) 
	- long LED becoming more common nowadays
	- detect re-emission
Refractometer - determine refractive index
	- Does not use transmitted light like dichroscopes
	- Mapped to tables, useful for unusual stones
Diamond tester - See if stone is diamond
	- Thermal conductivity and electrical
Microscope - stationary, 10X to 1000X
	- Find flaws in stone 
	- Find inclusions
Spectroscope - See what light is absorbed
Immersion cells and RI liquids - refractive index
	- See if stone is composite
	- Put in liquid. If same refractive, then light does not bend
Polariscope
	- Benchtop dichroscopes

19.3 - mineralogical tools

Polarizing Microscopes
	- for rock of 30 micro thickness
	- special filters to change light passed through
	- up to 400X magnification
	Also called petrographic microscopes
Raman microscope - minochromatic lazer to see scattered light
	- finds chemical makeup and structure of target, easy to interpret

19.4 - Ruby and Emerald have different colors due to difference in local crystal structure 
despite having same transition metal
