15.1

- Deposites might be put into two categories: containing pegmatite or not
	- But neglects other diverse environments in which they can form
- Good emerads are usually found in usual places
	- Red beryls from Utah
	- Emeralds from Columbia
	- Dark blue beryls from Yukon Territories
Good way to find deposits:
	- Identify source
	- understand transport mechanisms
	- Understand events that cause deposition
- Minerals needs to be sufficiency large and transparent to semi-transparent to be considered faceting
into genes	
- Large crystals require open space cavities in rocks

15.2

- Beryl is common in granitic pegmatites.
- Gem variety typically found in rare-element enriched pegmatites
	- ex. Li, Cs, Ta, Nb, Be, and yttrium(Y) and F
	- Cr and V introduced from intruding wall rocks
- Pegmatites have similar layers of onion. 
Outside: Border, wall Intermediate, core :Inside
- Highest quality from Core Zone or open space cavities
- Other gems in pegmatites include albite, spodumene, tourmaline, and quartz.
- Exceptional specimens usually are result of extreme crystal fractionation, volatile increases, or long
term geological stability

15.3

Magmatically-related production have two general modes
	- In situ (in the place)
	- hot hydrothermal fluid
In situ - interstitial or accessory Beryl
	- without concentrated on one place
	- Miarolitic cavities - open spaces resembling mini-pegmatites can host beryl formation
	- mostly aquamarine, but goshenite and morganite can occur too
Hydrothermal fluids
	- Hot water with large amount of dissolved fluids like Na, Cl, Si, CO2.
		- Contains sometimes Be, B, Li, and F
			- Labeled as fertile
	- can transport significant distances
	- corrode surounding rocks, changing mineral
	- Can form emeralds
Utah has red beryl
	- Rhyolite has beryl found in vesicles (volanic gas bubbles)
	- Has uniquely Mn
	
15.4

- Before thought to be in igneous sources, but actually can form in places wih regional metamorphism
- called "anomalous" beryl
- Can be mobilized to places where we can mine
- May or may not be associated with quartz veins and hydrothermal fluids.
- In Situ, more related to metamorphic sub-model
Ex. Columbia
	- hydrothermal fluids from sedimentary brine from host rock.
	- Uinta Mountain in USA gives similar scenario, but inferior to Columbia in size, number, and quality
Ex. Pakistan (Swat Valley) and Habachtal Region (Austria).
	- Cr rich rocks shears with other rock, creating Cr-bearing beryl. Quartz veins with beryl
	can form like this too
	
15.5

- Can be concentrated via weathering
- eluvial - carried from erosion without running water
	- contains "residual or resistant minerals"
- Colluvial - hillside. Do not concentrate but allows geologists to track gem from original
- Alluvial - From water
	- Placer deposits - contains diamonds and golds
- Beryl with SG of 2.75 doesn't allow it to concentrate in alluvial deposits as effectively as:
	- Gold (SG = 19)
	- Diamond (SG = 3.5)
	- Sapphire (SG = 4)
Emerald does not concentrate via alluvial or  coluuvial due to fracture rate
Sometimes durability plays a bigger role than gravity (density)

15.6

- Rare because there is very little beryllium, and only in pegmatites. Also, usually not enough
to grow big crystals
- Aquamarines can form more because iron is found in most geological places
- Emerald requires Cr and V, which are hard to meet due to mantel and crust
	- Requires unusual geological conditions
Columbian emerald deposits has no magmatic activity
	- from hist black shales
	
15.7

- Large crystals can be found in Madagascar, Russia,(Ural mountains), and US(the coasts)
- Single crystal can go up to 18m long and 3m across (several hundred tons)
- Guiness Crystal - 1785 carats with exceptional clarity. 
- Upper limited by vein formation and dynamic nature of vein
- 75.47 carat called Hooker Emerald found in Columbia, now in USA Washington.
More examples:
- Sword handle, 10cm, over 400 carats. Belonging to Joachim Murat, a French Calvary Commander
- Golden beryl from Brazil (now in museum of Natural History in Washington) is 2054 carats
- Largest are from aquamarine, morganite, goshenite, and pale green beryl (not emerald).
- Large emerald - 50 carat
- Large red beryl is about 5 carats

15.8 

Found in places like:

-Ural Mountains (Russia)
- High alpine pegmatites of Gilgit (Pakistan)
- Eluvial pegmatites from Madagascar
	- These places also produce morganites, goshenites, and heliodor
-Emerald from:
	- Zambia, Zimbabwe, Madagascar, Afganistan, Brazil, and Austria.
	- Nicest in Brazil
	
15.9

- 60% from columbia
- Others from Zambia, Brazil, and Zimbabwe.
	- Many countries with emerald have unstable politlcal environment, resulting in smuggling and 
	artisanal mining
- Aquamarine mainly from Afghanistan and Brazil. Madagascar also produces a lot

15.10

- Most of canada in Northern Cordilleran mountains of BC, Yukon, NWT. 
- Single occurance in Ontario
Ghost Lame emerald - near Dryden in NW Ontario.
	- Megmatite and schist (Cr source)
	- Others like K-feldspar, plagioclas, quartz, phlogopite, and tourmaline
Lened Emerald in NWT - vanadium black shales. With calcite and quartz. 
	- Says nearby graphite has emeralds, uncomfirmed
Yukon - Tsa da Glisza (Regal Ridge), 1998
	-Magmatic quartz veins
	-Has Cr schist
	- Emerald underlain by granite pluton, which is the source of Be
- Red Mountain in BC
	- 1989
	- V-dominant emerald
- Mackenzie Mountains of NWT
	- 2007, research at Laurentian University
	- Colored by Vanadium
- US 
	- Hiddenite,
	- North carolina
	- Unita mountains of Utah
	- Hiddenite and Utah has similar story to columbia
