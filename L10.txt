10.1

- Between 900 and 1200C required, and at about 150KM.
- Tempereature there is typically 1500C, so you end cold rocks
- Archean cratons - old (more than 2.5 billion years), old, and thick
	- can push a "keel" into upper mantle. B
- Base of keel is good for diamond growth (high pressure, cool temp)
- Temperature for diamond is called "diamond window". Else, you form graphite

10.2

- Not rare nowadays. Before, only found in alluvial deposits in India. 
- 50000 carat annually before
- millions per year 1900s
- 1950 - tens of million
- Today - 170 million

10.3 

- Peer-reviewed research lag behind due to confidentiality
- we can focus on archean aged cratons
- kimberlite discoveries now in Russia, Australia, and Canada
- 30 primary sites "in-situ"
- Phanerozoic - Young. 
- Archean - old
- "New world" - Minas Gerais region Brazil - Portuguese explorers
- 1872 - 1 million carats in South Africa, by "big hole" kimberlite mine
	1900 - 5 million
- 15 million 1950
- Other mines in Africa:
	- Premiur, Mwadui, Mbuji Maye
- Mir Diamond Mine in Russia
		- major blow to DaBeers monopoly
		- annual - 5 million anually.
		- By 1970, 10 million anually
- Other mines in Russia: Udachnya, Jubileynaya, Nyurba
- Australia 1983 mine Argyle Diamond Mine
	- lots of industrial diamonds
	- 40% diamond by volume by 1994
- Canada opens Ekati (BHP Billiton) followed by Diavik. Not really DaBeer's, despite their 3 decade
stay
- 2006, DaBeers droped from 11 minues to 7
- Total diamond = 6.5 billion carats
- Majority from Africa
- Da Beers > Alrsa > RioTint > BHP Billiton > Dominion Diamond

10.4

- By value, Canada is 3rd (16%)
- Ekati mines (first, in NorthWest Territories)
- Diavik Diamond mine (close to Ekati) in 2003 - 8 million carat annually
- Snake Lake Mine - also in NWT, 1,5 million carat in annually
	- owned by Da Beer
- Da Beer also owns Victor Mine
	- 2008 carats anually
- Canada got a large archean craton

10.5 

- UBC has Mineral Deposit Research Unit and Diamond Research Laboratory
- Diamond research group in Alberta is also big
